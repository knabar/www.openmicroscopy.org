                <p class="event-day-description">The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) is an open-source software project that develops tools that enable access, analysis, visualization, sharing and publication of biological image data. We support more than 150 image data formats across many imaging modalities including medical imaging, high-content screening and whole-slide imaging.
                We support and visualize multi-channel 3D timelapse images.
 
                OMERO, a component of OME, is a software platform for image data management and analysis which was presented in this course.
                Import, organisation, viewing, searching, annotation, analysis with Fiji and publishing of imaging data with OMERO was shown.

                The workshop concentrated on basics of OMERO and did not assume any programming skills.
