                <p class="event-day-description">This workshop will cover all of the main functions of OMERO. We will explain the import to OMERO and then demonstrate  organisation, viewing, searching, annotation and publishing of images using OMERO. After we cover the basics of OMERO, we will shortly explain the principles of how 3rd party image analysis packages work with OMERO. This will enable the participants to understand the manual data processing and automated processing workflows using a range of open source applications running alongside OMERO, such as ImageJ/Fiji or CellPose.
