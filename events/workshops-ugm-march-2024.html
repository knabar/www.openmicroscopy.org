                <p class="event-day-description">OMERO, a component of OME, is a software platform for image data management and analysis which was presented in the Workshop 1. 
                Import, organisation, viewing, searching, annotation and publishing of imaging data with OMERO were be shown.</p>
                <p class="event-day-description">
                Further, the emphasis was be given on the popular OMERO.figure application. Also, the specific use of OMERO as teaching tool for digital pathology was emphasized.

                <p class="event-day-description">
                During the Workshop 2 on the second day, we concentrated on more advanced OMERO topics, showing connections of OMERO with popular 3rd party image analysis machine learning and deep learning packages such as StarDist and CellPose. Also Fiji, Python and using OMERO Python API for running image analysis were shown.
