                <p class="event-day-description">The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) is an open-source software project that develops tools that enable access, analysis, visualization, sharing and publication of biological image data. We support more than 150 image data formats across many imaging modalities including medical imaging, high-content screening and whole-slide imaging.
                We support and visualize multi-channel 3D timelapse images.
 
                OMERO, a component of OME, is a software platform for image data management
                and analysis.

                <p class="event-day-description">
                The focus of this informal workshop was on:
                <ul>
                    <li>working with the OMERO API</li>
                    <li>integrating of OMERO.web apps</li>
                    <li>integrating analysis tools</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                Additionally, we continued the discussion from last year's users meeting and the <a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/proposal-for-4d-nucleome-microscopy-metadata-guidelines-based-on-the-ome-data-model/25970">more recent</a> community zoom call on building a framework for capturing, managing and querying metadata outside the OME-XML model.
                <p>
                <p>
                Participants were encouraged to list other potential topics on the registration forms.
