                Further, the emphasis was given on the popular OMERO.figure application.

                <p class="event-day-description">
                During the second day, we concentrated on more advanced OMERO topics, showing connections of OMERO with popular 3rd party image analysis software packages such as Fiji, Cellpose or StarDist and using OMERO Python API for running image analysis on the cloud.
