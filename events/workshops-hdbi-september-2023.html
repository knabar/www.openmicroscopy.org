                <p class="event-day-description">OMERO, a component of OME, is a software platform for image data management and analysis which was presented in this course. 
                Import, organisation, viewing and annotation of imaging data with OMERO were shown.</p>
                <p class="event-day-description">
                During the second hour, the Image Data Resource (IDR) was introduced, concentrating on the submission workflow and explaining the value of curation for this added-value resource.
                We also showed the transition from manual import of images and metadata to importing in bulk using text templates and the Command Line Interface.
