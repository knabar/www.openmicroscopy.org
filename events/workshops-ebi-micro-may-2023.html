                <p class="event-day-description">The usage of Image Data Resource (IDR) was explored and it was demonstrated how to access the IDR data using the Python API, to fetch image data and metadata from IDR study associated with a publication. A workflow involving programmatical harvesting of data from multiple Data resources (Humanmine and IDR) was shown. Further, re-analysis of data using an alternative segmentation tool to the one used by the publication authors was performed. The analytical packages used included Cellpose, StarDist and Cell Profiler. In the second workshop on the following day, the Distributed/Cloud computing workshop introduced an emerging cloud-optimized imaging format OME-NGFF currently used by the BioImage Archive and the Image Data Resource. It was shown how it can be used to access cloud-hosted imaging data and how it facilitates analysis in parallel, how to convert other formats into OME-NGFF and how to upload and download OME-NGFF images to and from S3 storage. The image analysis examples included workflows involving Cellpose and StarDist.
