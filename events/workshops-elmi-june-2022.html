                <p class="event-day-description">The Image Data Resource (IDR) was explored and it was demonstrated how to access the IDR data using the Python API, to fetch image data and metadata from IDR study associated with a publication. Further, re-analysis of data using an alternative segmentation tool to the one used by the publication authors was performed. Also, this workshop introduced an emerging cloud-compatible imaging format. It was shown how it can be used to access cloud-hosted imaging data and how it facilitates analysis in parallel threads.
