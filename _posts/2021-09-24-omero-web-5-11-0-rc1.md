Ahead of the 5.11.0 [security release](https://forum.image.sc/t/action-required-security-release-of-omero-web-and-omero-figure-coming-october-14th/57934), we are
releasing a pre-release version of OMERO.web, 5.11.0.rc1, which
fixes a few bugs, adds a few features and upgrades dependencies:
* jquery to 3.5.1
* jquery.ui to 1.12.1
* jstree to 3.3.10
* underscore to 1.13.1

We encourage developers of OMERO.web plugins to evaluate the impact of the dependencies upgrade on their applications.
