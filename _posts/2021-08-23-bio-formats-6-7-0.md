Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.7.0. This new release contains several file format updates, and several updates to resources for using Bio-Formats. We have also moved the readers for several open community formats to the BSD-2 license.

File format fixes and improvements:

* cellSens VSI
  * corrected offset checking to prevent seeking beyond EOF

* Deltavision
  * fixed a bug which resulted in an IndexOutOfBoundsException

* Hamamatsu ndpis
  * added support for channel names from NDP Shading Data

* Nikon NIS-Elements ND2
  * improved parsing of timestamp values (thanks to Ilya Parmon)
  * improved parsing of channel names and colors

* Olympus FluoView FV1000
  * fixed a bug with the handling of filter indexes

* OME-TIFF
  * resolution annotations now removed when resolutions are flattened
  * fixed handling of filesets with BinaryOnly across multiple folders

* PerkinElmer Operetta
  * channel colors now populated using emission wavelength

* TIFF
  * added support for Deflate compressed tiles/strips with lsb2msb order
  * prioritised units from TIFF tag over those from ImageJ comment

* Zeiss CZI
  * plates will now be correctly detected
  * added a new reader option ``zeissczi.relative_positions`` which when set to true 
     will change the PositionX and PositionY values stored in OME-XML to the pixel 
     position instead of the absolute physical stage position
  * added a new reader option ``zeissczi.trim_dimensions`` which when set to true will 
     use the pixel block metadata to trim XY dimensions to match those reported in ZEN

Bio-Formats improvements:
 
* the pattern reader now supports populating channel names from pattern tokens
* the channel filler will correctly reset bits per pixel if a lookup table is applied
* existing reader options are now registered in getAvailableOptions command
* improved performance of OME-XML validation (thanks to Nils Gladitz)
* added unit tests for the upgrade of custom attributes in OME-XML transforms

* added documentation for additional reader options
* fixed a number of broken links

The below have been relicensed under the more permissive BSD-2 clause:

* Big Data Viewer reader
* Keller Lab Block reader
* CellH5 reader
