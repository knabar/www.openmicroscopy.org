intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.server 5.6.8
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.8 which includes:

- support histogram for tiled images and fix generation of histogram for float images
- add default scanning period in logback.
- an upgrade of Bio-Formats to version 6.14.0, see the [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/07/05/bio-formats-6-14-0.html).

**Note:** This upgrade will invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please
see the upgrade guide for further information.
We also recommend to re-index the database especially if the OMERO server has a large number of High Content Screening data.


### Installing the Software:
