title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.4
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.4 which uses OMERO.blitz 5.5.10
and includes Bio-Formats 6.9.1, see [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/04/20/bio-formats-6-9-1.html).
The Bio-Formats Memoizer cache **will be invalidated** on upgrade from OMERO.server 5.6.3.

The OMERO pyramid generation process should be considered as deprecated, please read the [recommendations](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/latest/sysadmins/limitations.html) on how to proceed.


OMERO.server 5.6.4 runs in the same deployment environments as
OMERO.server 5.6.0. It has been tested with OMERO.py 5.11.1 and OMERO.web
5.14.0 which includes support for Django 3.2.x, see [release OMERO.web announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/03/21/omero-web-5.14.0.html).
Both OMERO.py and OMERO.web are available from PyPI. 

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes with the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.3/>.

This release has been tested with
[OMERO.py 5.11.1](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.11.1/) and
[OMERO.web 5.14.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.14.0/) so we
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py and OMERO.web to at least 5.11.1 and 5.14.0 on
both server and web deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag:

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
