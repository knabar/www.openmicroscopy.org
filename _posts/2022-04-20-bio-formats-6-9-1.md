Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.9.1, the full list of changes and updates:

File format fixes and improvements:

* DeltaVision
   - allowed partial planes to be read from truncated files

* MetaMorph
   - fixed a NumberFormatException when parsing double values in metdata

* OME-TIFF
   - performance improvements to reduce the number of open file handles during initialization

* PerkinElmer Operetta
   - performance improvements to speed up the reading of datasets (thanks to Nicolas Chiaruttini)

* Zeiss CZI
   - switched to a white background for brightfield data to better match Zeiss Zen software

* Zeiss LSM
   - fixed a bug that resulted in an incorrect pixel type for some floating point data

Bio-Formats improvements:

* removed the maven deploy step from workflows in forked repositories
* upgraded cdm dependency from 4.6.13 to cdm-core 5.3.3
* configurable sleep time in FakeReader moved to the end of initialization

Documentation improvements:

* DICOM format page updated with improved links for sample datasets, software, and specification
* updated guidelines for submitting sample datasets

Correction note on the previous 6.9.0 release:

For the previous release of Bio-Formats 6.9.0, the command line tools and downloadable components listed on the openmicroscopy website mistakenly did not include the full list of changes advertised in the release the notes. The Bio-Formats 6.9.0 artefacts deployed on artifacts.openmicroscopy.org were correct and contained the full list of changes. Clients consuming Bio-Formats as a Maven dependency will have been unaffected.
