Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.8.0. This new release contains several file format updates including new readers and writers.

New file formats:

     This functionality was implemented through collaboration with 
     [NCI Imaging Data Commons](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons/), 
     and has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the National Cancer Institute,
     National Institutes of Health, under Task Order No. HHSN26110071 under Contract No. HHSN2612015000031
