title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.5
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.5 which includes:

- a new server configuration allowing to control the pyramidal requirement for floating-point images
- an upgrade of Bio-Formats to version 6.10.0, see [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/05/31/bio-formats-6-10-0.html).
- the inclusion of the OMEZarrReader version 0.3.0 for reading OME-NGFF data

Note the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache **will be invalidated** on upgrade from earlier OMERO.server versions.

The loading of OME-NGFF data (version 0.1 to 0.4) is currently only available using the command-line
interface - see the [limitations](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/limitations.html) page
for more details.

Finally, the OMERO.server technical documentation has  been migrated to Read the Docs and
the documentation for the stable version is available from <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>.

### Installing the Software:
