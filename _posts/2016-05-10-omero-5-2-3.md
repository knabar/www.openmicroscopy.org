Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.3, a bug-fix release. Improvements include:

-  better support for metadata annotations in clients including tag/tagset support and performance issues
-  fixes in OMERO.web for deleting MIFs
-  improvements to the navigation of large datasets and display of plates in OMERO.web
-  other OMERO.web bug fixes
-  OMERO.insight and CLI import improvements
-  other OMERO.insight bug fixes, including for downloading data

Developer updates include:

System administrator updates include:
 
-  Ice 3.6.2 support for UNIX-like systems, including specific installation walkthroughs
-  redis support for websessions caching

-  warnings added regarding the end of Windows support in the [5.3.0 release](https://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/deployment/2016/03/22/windows-support/) (note that we will be preparing a guide for migrating from Windows for existing servers and adding it to the documentation as soon as we can)
