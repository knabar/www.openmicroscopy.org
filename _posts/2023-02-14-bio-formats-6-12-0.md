title: Release of Bio-Formats 6.12.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 6.12.0
---

Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.12.0 with a number of significant changes. Most notably for the developer community you will find that Bio-Formats has now been updated to fully support Java 17.

Additionally in this release there have been changes to the logging dependencies which will require action from developers who consume Bio-Formats. Bio-Formats previously included a logback dependency which is now marked as optional, this will require developers to directly declare a dependency for a SLF4J binding such as [logback](https://logback.qos.ch/). For further details on the changes to the logging dependencies and links to examples please see the [logging documentation](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/developers/logging.html) page.
