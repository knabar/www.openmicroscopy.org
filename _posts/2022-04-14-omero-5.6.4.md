title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.4
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.4 which uses OMERO.blitz 5.5.9
and includes Bio-Formats 6.9.0, see [release annoucement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/02/24/bio-formats-6-9-0.html).
The Bio-Formats Memoizer cache **will be invalidated** on upgrade from OMERO.server 5.6.3.


OMERO.server 5.6.4 runs in the same deployment environments as
OMERO.server 5.6.0. It has been tested with OMERO.py 5.11.1 and OMERO.web
5.14.0 which includes support for Django 3.2.x, see [release OMERO.web annoucement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/03/21/omero-web-5.14.0.html).
Both ware available from PyPI. 

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes with the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.6.4/>.

This release has been tested with
[OMERO.py 5.11.1](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.11.1/) and
[OMERO.web 5.14.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.14.0/) so we
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py and OMERO.web to at least 5.11.1 and 5.14.0 on
both server and web deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag:

You are invited to discuss this announcement on

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
