Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 7.2.0 which includes a number of format improvements for Aperio SVS, Olympus OIR and Zeiss CZI.

The full list of changes included in this release are as follows:

File format fixes and improvements:

* Aperio SVS
   - improved detection of label and macro images
   - thumbnails are now removed by default
   - added a new reader option `svs.remove_thumbnail` to control the thumbnail behaviour. 
     By default the option is true and thumbnails are removed. Setting the option to false 
     will restore the previous behavior and include thumbnails

* Imaris HDF
   - channel names are now correctly populated

* Olympus OIR
   - fixed an issue with channel ordering
   - prevent certain pixel blocks from being incorrectly skipped

* TIFF
   - dimension order is now marked as certain if metadata is read from ImageJ tag

* Zeiss CZI
   - improved well column indexing by using alternate sources for well identifiers when available
   - improved image naming, particularly for attachments
   - fixed a bug so that opening CZI compressed with ZSTD now allows access to pyramid levels (thanks to Stephan Wagner-Conrad)
   - fixed an integer arithmetic problem when calculating pyramid scales (thanks to Stephan Wagner-Conrad)

Bio-Formats improvements:

* JPEG handling no longer fails for non 4:4:4 JPEG (thanks to Can Gokhan Dogan)
* fixed a bug in the Bio-Formats Plugins configuration window when toggling the Nikon ND2 chunkmap option
* updated testing to add an additional check for image names when resolutions are not flattened

Documentation improvements:
