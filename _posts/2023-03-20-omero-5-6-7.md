title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.7
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.server 5.6.7
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.7 which includes:

- addressing performance issues when indexing fileset
- a new property [omero.search.max_fileset_size](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.7/sysadmins/config.html#omero.search.max_fileset_size) to configure the QA system the feedback is submitted to.
- running the PixelDataThread Application events in SYSTEM Thread pool
- declaring logback-classic as explicit dependency and set to 1.2.x
- an upgrade of Bio-Formats to the last released version 6.12.0, see the [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/02/14/bio-formats-6-12-0.html).


Note that the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache **will be invalidated** on upgrade from earlier OMERO.server versions.
We also recommend to re-index the database especially if the OMERO server has a large number of High Content Screening data.


### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes included in the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
