intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 5.2.4
---
Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.2.4, a bug-fix release mainly addressing
a regression that was introduced in 5.2.0.

Improvements for two formats:

*  OME-TIFF
    *  fixed regression when populating plane metadata
*  CZI
    *  populated series metadata with the scene/position information

Full details can be found in the [Bio-Formats version history]({{ site.baseurl }}/site/support/bio-formats5.2/about/whats-new.html)

Any problems or comments, please use the
[OME Forums or mailing lists]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).

The software is available at 
[archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.2.4).
