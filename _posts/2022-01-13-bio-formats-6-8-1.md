Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.8.1. This new release contains several file format updates and security fixes.

File format fixes and improvements:

* Aperio SVS / Aperio AFI
   - improved handling of macro and label images when no image description is present

* cellSens VSI
   - added support for physicalSizeZ metadata

* Gatan Digital Micrograph DM4
   - fixed a FormatException when encountering null values in the metadata

Bio-Formats improvements:

* fixed a bug in TiffSaver which could result in an invalid TIFF when saving a file with tiling and compression (thanks to Pete Bankhead)
* made performance improvements to TIFF reading and writing (thanks to Pete Bankhead)

Security improvements:

* Updated use of the git:// protocol in POM as it has now been deprecated. See the 
     [GitHub blog post](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/) for further details
* Removed the loci_tools from Bio-Formats builds due to log4j vulnerability, users should instead use bioformats_package.
