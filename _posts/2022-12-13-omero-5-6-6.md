---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.6 which includes:

- a new property [omero.qa.feedback](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.6/sysadmins/config.html#omero.qa.feedback) to configure the QA system the feedback is submitted to.
- the option for [omero.server.nodedescriptors](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.6/sysadmins/config.html#omero.server.nodedescriptors) to be queried from a client.
- an enhancement of the Command line importer developer user experience
-  an upgrade of Bio-Formats to the last released version 6.11.1, see the [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/12/01/bio-formats-6-11-1.html).



Note that the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache **will be invalidated** on upgrade from earlier OMERO.server versions.

Finally, the OMERO.server technical documentation has been migrated to Read the Docs and
the documentation for the stable version is available from <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>.
