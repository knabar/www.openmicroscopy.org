intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.server 5.6.12
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.12 which includes:

- Handle archive status being populated. Related to https://github.com/ome/omero-web/pull/555
- Add more tests using the Tables service
- an upgrade of Bio-Formats to version 7.3.1, see the [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/07/11/bio-formats-7-3-1.html).
- an update of IceGrid templates to make OMERO.tables more configurable. 


**Note:** This upgrade will not invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please
see the upgrade guide for further information. This upgrade will require an upgrade of OMERO.py to 5.19.4
to ensure that the Tables service starts as expected. If OMERO.py is not upgraded, the Tables service will
be marked as inactive.


### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes included in the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
