### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes included in the OMERO 5.6 series see the
[OMERO 5.6.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/01/15/omero-5-6-0.html) release
announcement. Note that the present [list of supported versions](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.10/sysadmins/version-requirements.html) changed in the meantime. Full documentation for this release is available
under <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.10/>.

This release has been tested with
[OMERO.py 5.17.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-py/5.17.0/) and
[OMERO.web 5.23.0](https://pypi.org/project/omero-web/5.23.0/). We
recommend that you upgrade OMERO.py and OMERO.web accordingly on your deployments.

Official Docker images are available as usual on Docker Hub with either
the latest or the 5.6 tag. Both Docker images have been upgraded to Rocky Linux 9:

* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-server>
* <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmicroscopy/omero-web-standalone>

**Note:** 
The [Ansible roles](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/namespaces/5249/) have also been upgraded to support Ubuntu 22.04 and RHEL 9/Rocky Linux 9. 
The primary roles, [omero-server](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/ome/omero_server/) and [omero-web](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/ome/omero_web/) allow to install respectively the OMERO.server and OMERO.web.

All the best with your upgrades,

The OME Team
