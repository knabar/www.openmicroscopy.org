intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of OMERO.server 5.6.9
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.9 which includes:

- remove support for ADH and let Ice choose the default SSL protocol.
- revert "Java client init: no "anon" among jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms"
- an upgrade of Bio-Formats to version 7.0.0, see the [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/08/01/bio-formats-7-0-0.html).

We also recommend to review the ``Server certificate`` section of the uprade page <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/server-upgrade.html>.

**Note:** This upgrade will invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache. Please
see the upgrade guide for further information.
We also recommend to re-index the database especially if the OMERO server has a large number of High Content Screening data.


### Installing the Software:
