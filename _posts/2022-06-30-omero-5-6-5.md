title: Release of OMERO.server 5.6.5
---

Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.5 which includes:

-   a new [omero.pixeldata.max_plane_float_override](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.5/sysadmins/config.html#omero.pixeldata.max_plane_float_override)
    server configuration allowing to control the pyramidal requirement for floating-point images
-   an upgrade of Bio-Formats to the last released version 6.10.0, see the [release announcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/05/31/bio-formats-6-10-0.html).
-   the [OMEZarrReader](https://github.com/ome/ZarrReader/) version 0.3.0

The OMEZarrReader inclusion allows the server to import imaging data written according to the 
[OME-NGFF](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) specification. The reader supports OME-NGFF datasets
for all published versions of the specification (up to and including 0.4) and reads OME-XML
metadata stored using the layout written by Glencoe Software's
[bioformats2raw](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw) utility. This
metadata layout is currently being reviewed for formal inclusion into the OME-NGFF specification - see
[the relevant discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/ome/ngff/pull/112).
OME-NGFF import is currently only available using the command-line interface, see the
[limitations](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/limitations.html#ngff-limitations) page
for more details.

Note that the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache **will be invalidated** on upgrade from earlier OMERO.server versions.

Finally, the OMERO.server technical documentation has been migrated to Read the Docs and
the documentation for the stable version is available from <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>.
