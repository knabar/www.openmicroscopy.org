Today we are releasing OMERO 5.2.7. 

This is a release aimed at system administrators or developers wanting to build OMERO with Ice 3.6.3.

This release also upgrades the version of Bio-Formats which OMERO uses to [5.1.10]({{ site.baseurl }}/site/support/bio-formats5.1/about/whats-new.html).

All scripts handling Regions of Interest (ROIs) now support ROI not linked to any plane as defined by the OME Model.

The software is available at [archived downloads](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.2.7).
