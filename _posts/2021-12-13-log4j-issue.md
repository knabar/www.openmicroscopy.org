Major news carriers have been reporting recently on log4j vulnerabilities in
Java applications. Both the OME team in Dundee as well as Glencoe Software have
evaluated the libraries used by OMERO.server and OMERO.insight. We can say with
confidence that OMERO and OMERO Plus are not vulnerable, as they do not utilize log4j
and no immediate action that needs to be taken.

The only remaining use of log4j in OME software is in the
[deprecated](https://imagej.net/pipermail/imagej-devel/2015-March/002513.html)
`loci_tools.jar` which we will now be removing. The `bioformats_package.jar` uber-jar
provides the same functionality using the [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) library
for logging. This has been published as
[2021-SV4 log4j in loci_tools.jar]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/advisories/2021-SV4).
