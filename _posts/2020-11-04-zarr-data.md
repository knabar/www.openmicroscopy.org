The OME team is leading a community effort to design a new cloud-friendly "Next Generation" file format.
See the [announcement](https://forum.image.sc/t/next-generation-file-formats-for-bioimaging/31361)
and other image.sc posts tagged with [ome-ngff](https://forum.image.sc/tag/ome-ngff).

The [ome-zarr spec](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/spec.md) is currently
under development and includes a changelog with version numbers.
A [number of tools](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/related.md) are being developed
to work with ome-zarr data.

As part of this work, we are converting sample datasets from the [IDR](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
into ome-zarr, to correspond to each version of the spec.
These are publicly available and hosted on s3 storage at ebi.

We aim to maintain old versions (the version number is included in the URL), so some files will
be available in multiple versions. The earliest available version is listed for each Image.
