The OME team is leading a community effort to design a new cloud-friendly "Next Generation" file format.
See the [announcement](https://forum.image.sc/t/next-generation-file-formats-for-bioimaging/31361)
and other image.sc posts tagged with [ome-ngff](https://forum.image.sc/tag/ome-ngff).

The [ome-zarr spec](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/spec.md) is currently
under development and includes a changelog with version numbers.
A [number of tools](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/related.md) are being developed
to work with ome-zarr data. The [vizarr](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vizarr) viewer is used below to view ome-zarr images.

As part of this work, we are converting sample datasets from the [IDR](http://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
into ome-zarr, to correspond to each version of the spec.
These are publicly available and hosted on s3 storage at ebi.
Below are listed Images converted into version 0.1 of the ome-zarr spec. This list is also available in
[JSON format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ome/blog/master/_data/zarr_data_2020-11-04.json).

We are currently working on a spec for representing HCS data in ome-zarr. When this spec is finalised, we
will also provide links to sample HCS data in this format.
