title: Release of Bio-Formats 6.13.0
intro-blurb: The OME team is pleased to announce the release of Bio-Formats 6.13.0
---

Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 6.13.0 with a number of significant changes including a number of dependency updates and a significant number of format fixes. We have also made some API additions, allowing users to configure a fill color for undefined pixels as well as the option to preserve the original creator tag when writing OME-TIFF and OME-XML. The JPEGCodec has also been updated to allow the JPEG quality to be configured using the existing CodecOptions. A special thanks as always to the external contributors who have helped make this release happen. 

The full list of changes included in this release are as follows:

File format fixes and improvements:

* Aperio SVS
   - removed broken special case path when there is only one (pyramidal) image 
     (thanks to Alexandr Virodov)

* Bio-Rad Gel
   - fixed pixel data offsets for cropped images

* cellSens VSI
   - improved tile decoding to fail faster on invalid tiles

* CellWorX/MetaXpress
   - fixed a bug when retrieving channel metadata when the files for the entire first 
     field are missing

* CV7000
   - extra folders mixed in with the plate data will now be ignored
   - corrected channel indexing if a subset of channels was acquired

* Lambert Instruments FLIM
   - added support for Fli 2.0 (thanks to Shaquille Louisa - Lambert Instruments)

* MetaMorph
   - prevented an exception when attempting to read metadata keys that don't exist

* MetaMorph TIFF
   - fixed a NullPointerException when there are missing stage positions

* MRC
   - the IMOD flag is now used to determine int8 or uint8 pixel type

* NIFTI
   - improved the performance for gzip-compressed files by reducing the number 
     of backwards seeks

* Nikon ND2
   - fixed an exception when reading blocks greater than 2GB

* OME-TIFF
   - file paths are now normalized rather than resolving symlinks

* Perkin Elmer Operetta
   - fixed series validation for single plane images (thanks to Alex Herbert)

* Zeiss CZI
   - improved the tile stitching when a pyramid does not exist


Bio-Formats improvements:

* added a new writer option `preserve_creator` for OME-TIFF and OME-XML writers. 
  When set to true the original OME/Creator attribute will be preserved by the writer. 
  If set to false, the OME Creator attribute will be updated to include the current 
  Bio-Formats version. Attribute is set to false by default.
* enabled the configuration of the fill value for undefined pixel values through new 
  API additions to IFormatReader. Two new methods (along with default implementations) 
  have been added for `setFillColor(Byte color)` and `Byte getFillColor()`, the default 
  value if undefined is 0.
* added a new `-fill` option to the command line tools, allowing a byte value to be 
  configured for use with undefined pixels (0-255)
* enabled the configuration of JPEG quality in the JPEGCodec using the existing quality 
  setting on `CodecOptions` (thanks to Peter Haub)
* improved JPEG performance by using in-memory cache in JPEGCodec (thanks to Pete Bankhead)
* made minor API updates to `Memoizer` to allow a null reader to be specified in the 
  constructors, in which case a new `ImageReader` will be wrapped
* prevented file leaks in FileStitcher by closing readers when setting the class list
* fixed exceptions in FileStitcher when a no-op file pattern is encountered
* updated GitHub Actions release process


Documentation improvements:

* updated the format page for MRC to clarify list of developers and add links to latest specifications
* added new developer documentation pages for Bioconductor RBioFormats 
* corrected one of the examples in the OME-TIFF specification page (thanks to Tom Boissonnet)
* updated the list of writer options to add documentation for new `preserve_creator` options
* updated the list of command line tools options to add documentation for new `fill` option
* version history and bug reporting are now linked from the main documentation page
* fixed a number of broken links
* updated the Li-Flim format page to add supported versions
