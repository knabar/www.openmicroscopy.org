Today we are releasing OMERO.server 5.6.13 which includes:

- This release reverts a change to the build process introduced in 5.6.12 that resulted in
unused copies of old jars being included in the release. No other changes have been
made to the software.

**Note:** This upgrade will not invalidate the Bio-Formats Memoizer cache if you are updating
from OMERO 5.6.11 or later. Please see the upgrade guide for further information.

### Installing the Software:

For full details of the changes included in the OMERO 5.6 series see the
